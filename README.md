# principalcomponentanalyis
In this notebook, we will pick a dataset with 6 independent variables and do principal component analysis on the independent variables. Using the PCA results, we will reduce the dimensionality of the data set. Finally we will construct simple linear regression models with the original independent variables and contrast it against a model with the new reduced set of variables constructed using PCA
